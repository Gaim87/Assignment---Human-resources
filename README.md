This program is a simple Human Resources application for managing employees' personal and business information. You can use it to register and edit salaried or hourly employees and the data is permanently saved in a text file.

It was written in C#, using Visual Studio 2019's Windows Forms project template, for a module that tested our ability to develop an application of moderate complexity by applying object-oriented programming concepts, techniques and constructs.

The basic classes of the source code were given to us beforehand and our tasks were to finish the Load Method (loads employee data from the external text file), enable the editing of personal details by double-clicking a name, implement a Save button that saves data to the external file, include functionality for adding new employees, and implement the IComparable interface among others.

You can build and run the program by opening the .sln file in Visual Studio (https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/). The list box at the window's left side contains all registered employees' names and you can edit their personal details by double-clicking on a name or selecting it and pressing "Edit Employee Details".
